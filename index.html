            <p>Technology is the application of knowledge to reach practical goals in a specifiable and reproducible
                way.[1] The word technology may also mean the product of such an endeavor.[2]: 117 [3] The use of
                technology is widely prevalent in medicine, science, industry, communication, transportation, and daily
                life. Technologies include physical objects like utensils or machines and intangible tools such as
                software.</p>
            <p>Many technological advancements have led to societal changes. The earliest known technology is the stone
                tool, used in the prehistoric era,[4] followed by fire use, which contributed to the growth of the human
                brain and the development of language in the Ice Age.[5] The invention of the wheel in the Bronze Age
                enabled wider travel and the creation of more complex machines.[6] Recent technological developments,
                including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet have lowered communication barriers and
                ushered in the knowledge economy.</p>
            <p>While technology contributes to economic development and human prosperity, it can also have negative
                impacts like pollution or resource depletion, or cause social harms like technological unemployment
                caused by automation.[7] As a result, philosophical and political debates have arisen over the role and
                use of technology, the ethics of technology, and the mitigation of technology's potential downsides.[8]
                Historical and contemporary movements like neo-Luddism and anarcho-primitivism criticize technology's
                pervasiveness,[9] while adherents to transhumanism and techno-progressivism actively support
                technological change, viewing it as emancipatory.[10] Many negative impacts of technology can be
                mitigated through technological innovations like renewable energy in transportation and industry,[11]
                genetically modified crops to address soil depletion,[12] and space exploration to mitigate global
                catastrophic risks.[13]</p>
